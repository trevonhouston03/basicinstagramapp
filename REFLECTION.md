# REFLECTION

## 1. What did you ask GitHub Copilot to help you build?
I asked Copilot to help me build a basic Instagram clone app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
I asked it to help with:
- Creating a comment section
- Adding a dislike button for each post
- Styling the feed and posts

## 2. How did your approach to asking questions change as you worked?
 I gave Copilot simple questions like changing the colors of the app/website but then I went into the complex questions like asking it to add a dislike button.

## 3. What parts of the development process with GitHub Copilot surprised you?
- It defintely saved a lot of time making the application. I know it's not perfect but If I took my sweet time and worried about perfection then I think this would be one of the best project I made in a while

## 4. What did you learn about the technology you used that you didn't know before?
- I learned how to structure a simple web app with HTML, CSS, and JS in separate files.

## 5. What would you do differently if you had to build this again?
- I would break down features into even smaller steps and commit more often.  
- I would add more comments in the coding to explain why I did such and such
- I would ask it to help me code and understand it instead of just telling it to write me code
